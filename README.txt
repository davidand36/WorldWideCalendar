The WorldWideCalendar.info Web site presents information about various calendars
used around the world, currently or historically. It allows for the conversion 
between dates in these calendars, displays monthly calendar tables (or the
equivalent; not all calendars use months per se), and shows explanatory text
about the calendars.

The site uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client side. It uses
AJAX to communicate with the server, where most of the computation is done.

The server app is written in C++ as a FastCGI service. It relies on several of the libEpsilonDelta libraries, available at https://github.com/davidand36/libEpsilonDelta.git .
