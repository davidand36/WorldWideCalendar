<p>The civil calendar used for millennia in ancient Egypt and as far away as Babylonia and Persia. It was also used for astronomical ephemerides by Copernicus and other astronomers, no doubt in part because of its simplicity and also because it was the calendar of the Alexandrian astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy).</p>

<p>Twelve months of thirty days each, followed by five extra days (epagomenæ).</p>

<p>Arithmetic. While the Egyptian month length approximates the mean synodic lunar month (about 29.53 days), its fixed length, the nearly half-day difference, and, most important, the presence of the epagomonæ, mean that the New Moon did not occur at the same time of each month.</p>

<p>The Egyptian calendar comes closer to being a solar calendar: Both the heliacal rising of Sirius (which is determined by the length of the sidereal year) and the annual flooding of the Nile (governed by the tropical year) would have drifted slowly along the Egyptian calendar, since both of these periods exceed the 365-day Egyptian year by about 1/4 day. But the drift was slow enough, with a cycle of about 1460 years, to be barely noticable in a single lifetime, though ancient astronomers, who kept careful and lasting records, were well aware of it.</p>

<p>The epoch used here is that adopted by Ptolemy, the Nabonassar era, is Julian Day 1448638 (18 Feb 747 B.C.E. Gregorian). Obviously the calendar was in use well before this.</p>

<p>The designation of months changed over time. In the Old Kingdom the months were numbered within each of the three seasons, Axt (flood), Prt (growth), and Smw (harvest). Months were given names in the Middle and New Kingdoms. By the time of Ptolemy (c. 90-168 C.E.), the names were Hellenized.</p>
