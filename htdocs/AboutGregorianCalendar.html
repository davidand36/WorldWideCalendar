<p>The calendar of modern Christianity and the common civil calendar of most of the world.</p>

<p>Established by Pope Gregory XIII on 15 October 1582 C.E., which followed 4 October 1582 A.D. in the Julian calendar. It was adopted immediately in Catholic states, and gradually by Protestant ones. (Great Britain and her colonies, including the United States, waited until 1752; Russia, until 1918.)</p>

<p>Identical to the Julian calendar, with one exception: Twelve months of fixed lengths of 30 or 31 days with the exception of February, which has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, which occur every four years. The exception is that every year divisible by 100 but not by 400 is common.</p>

<p>An arithmetic solar calendar. The leap year scheme was intended to keep the mean year close to the mean tropical solar year. (The modification to the Julian calendar was made to improve this approximation.) On the other hand, the months correspond only loosely to the phases of the Moon, having been (mostly) lengthed to fit the solar year.</p>

<p>Epoch: Year 1 C.E. (Common Era or Anno Domini (A.D.)) began on Julian Day 1,721,426. The preceding year is generally denoted 1 B.C.E., but the use of 0 and negative numbers has become popular, especially among astronomers (beginning with Cassini in 1740 C.E.).</p>
