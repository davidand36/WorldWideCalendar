<p>Traditional calendar used in much of East Asia.</p>

<p>Historical usage dates from about 1384 B.C.E., though Chinese tradition is that the calendar was invented by the Yellow Emperor, Huang Di, in 2637 B.C.E. (For civil purposes, the Gregorian calendar has been used since 1912 C.E.) There have been a number of calendar reforms. The calendar implemented here is the modern one, developed by Jesuit missionaries in 1645 C.E. at the request of the emperor.</p>

<p>Astronomical. Originally, motions of the mean Sun and Moon were used. The reform of 619 C.E. introduced the true Moon, but retained the mean Sun. The modern version uses the best computational methods available to determine the true longitudes of the Sun and Moon.</p>

<p>Lunisolar. Months are based on actual lunar phases (beginning with the New Moon), but leap months are intercalated when necessary so that the Winter Solstice always falls in the eleventh month.</p>

<p>Years are not generally counted in a linear fashion, as here. Traditionally, the year count began in the year following the death of the previous emperor, though some emperors divided their reigns into regnal periods (nien hao). In addition, years are denoted by their position in 10- and 12-year cycles (celestial stems and terrestrial branches), which together generate a 60-year cycle. There is some disagreement about numbering these cycles, however. Here we adopt the convention that begins the first cycle in 2637 B.C.E., so that the epoch is Julian Day 758,326 (15 February 2637 B.C.E. Gregorian).</p>

<p>There are also 60-day and 60-month cycles, using the same stem-and-branch system used for years. The animal names traditionally associated with the terrestrial branches are not translations of the Chinese names of those branches, which, like those of the stems, are untranslatable. This "zodiac" varies regionally.</p>

<p>The Sun's location is described in terms of major (jiéqì) and minor (zhōngqì) solar terms, each covering 30° of solar longitude. (The minor terms are offset 15° from the major terms.)</p>
