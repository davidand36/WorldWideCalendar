<p>The calendar of the Roman Empire, the Julian calendar became the calendar of the Christian world, though it has gradually been replaced by the Gregorian calendar in the West. Most of the Orthodox Christian church continues to use the Julian calendar for the determination of religious holidays (movable feasts).</p>

<p>Established by Julius Caeser, in consultation with Sisogenes of Alexandria, on 1 January 709 A.U.C. (ad urbe condita) = 1 January 45 B.C. (Julian) = 30 December 45 B.C.E. (Gregorian). It was a modification of the Roman Republic and ancient Egyptian calendars.</p>

<p>Twelve months of fixed lengths of 30 or 31 days with the exception of February, which has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, which occur every four years.</p>
  
<p>Arithmetic. A solar calendar. The leap year scheme was intended to keep the mean year close to the mean tropical solar year. (The Gregorian calendar improved on this.) On the other hand, the months correspond only loosely to the phases of the Moon, having been (mostly) lengthed to fit the solar year.</p>

<p>Epoch: Under the Roman Empire, years generally were not numbered consecutively, but designated instead based on the ruling consuls. When year numbering was required, the legendary year of the founding of Rome, ab urbe condita (A.U.C.) was used. Historians differed on this date, but that given by Varro, 753 B.C.E. has been adopted by modern historians. To complicate matters further, the A.U.C. year began, at least for some, on 21 April.</p>

<p>The early Christian world often used Anno Diocletiani, counting years from the reign of Emperor Diocletian, as the Coptic calendar still does. In the sixth century C.E., Dionysius Exiguus of Rome estimated the year of Jesus's birth. (He probably erred by a few years.) Within a few centuries his estimate became the basis of the Christian era. Year 1 Anno Domini (A.D.) began on Julian Day 1,721,424. The convention for numbering year prior to this was introduced by the Venerable Bede around 731 C.E. Because the concept of zero had not yet been developed in Europe, the year before 1 A.D. became 1 B.C.</p>
