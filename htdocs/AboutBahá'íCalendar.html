<p>The calendar of the Bahá'í</p>

<p>Created c. 1844 C.E. (Gregorian) by the Báb (Siyyid `Alí-Muḥammad of Shiriz) and codified by Bahá'u'lláh (Mírzá Ḥusayn-`Alí Núrí). The details of the ideal Bahá'í calendar are still being worked out, so there is some variation in practice. In the West (Europe and the Americas) a somewhat simplified version is used, while in the East (Iran, Israel, and other Middle Eastern countries) the "future" Bahá'í calendar is being developed.</p>

<p>Every year has 19 months of 19 days each, with the final month preceded by an intercalary period (Ayyám-i-Há) of four days in common years and five in leap years. Particularly in the Eastern version, years are counted in 19-year cycles called Váḥid, and 19-Váḥid cycles called Kull-i-Shay.</p>

<p>A solar calendar, beginning the year on or near the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>The Western version is arithmetic and leap years are synchronized to the Gregorian calendar. The Eastern ("future") version is astronomical. The location on which to base the calculations has not yet been established by the Universal House of Justice. Current practice in the East is to use Tehran; a future possibility is to use Haifa.</p>

<p>Epoch: Year 1 of the Bahá'í Era (B.E.) is Julian Day JD 2,394,647 (21 March 1844 C.E. Gregorian).</p>
