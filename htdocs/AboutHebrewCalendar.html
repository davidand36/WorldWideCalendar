<p>The calendar of the Jews.</p>

<p>Promulgated in the mid-fourth century (perhaps 359) C.E. by the Patriarch, Hillel II.</p>

<p>Twelve or thirteen months, some with fixed 29- or 30-day lengths, others which varied between the two.</p>

<p>Arithmetic. Lunisolar: The mean length of the Hebrew month matches the mean synodic month estimated by Cidenas (c. 383 B.C.E.) and used by Ptolemy in the <em>Almagest</em>. Thus the months closely follow the phases of the Moon, on average. Also, leap months (Adar II) are added to avoid seasonal drift; the mean length of the Hebrew year is close to the mean tropical year.</p>

<p>The Hebrew calendar is complicated in a number of ways, primarily to conform with various conventions established in the Hebrew Bible. For one thing, the year begins with the seventh month, Tishri. For another, the lengths of the month Mará¸¥eshvan and Kislev are adjusted not only to maintain the proper mean month length, but also to conform with several rules. For example, Yom Kippur (10 Tishri) cannot fall on a Friday or Sunday.</p>

<p>Epoch: 1 A.M. (Anno Mundi, the traditional year of the world since creation), is JD 347,998 (7 September 3761 B.C.E. Gregorian).</p>

<p>The day begins at sunset for religious purposes, which is deemed 6 p.m. for civil purposes.</p>
