<p>The calendar of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Based on the Jalālī calendar designed by a committee of Persian astronomers (among them, Omar Khayyām) convened in 1073 C.E. at the behest of Sultan Jalāl. Legally adopted in Iran in 1925 C.E., early in the Pahlavi dynasty.</p>

<p>Twelve months every year: six 31-day months followed by five 30-day months, followed by Esfand, which has 29 days in common years and 30 in leap years.</p>

<p>An astronomical solar calendar, with leap years determined so that local noon (in Tehran) of New Year (Naw Ruz) follows the vernal equinox. An algorithmic version has also been proposed by Ahmad Birashk that approximates the mean tropical year with great accuracy.</p>

<p>Epoch: Year 1 Anno Hegiræ Solar (A.H.S. or Anno Persico (A.P.)) 1,948,321, the year of the Hijra. For two years around 1976 A.D., the epoch was changed so that 1355 A.H.S. became 2535 Sh. (Shahinshah Era) and 1356 A.H.S. became 2536 Sh.</p>
