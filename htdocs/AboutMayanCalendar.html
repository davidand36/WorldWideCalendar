<p>The Mayan civilization, which has lasted for thousands of years, reaching its peak from about 250 to 900 C.E., had three principle calendars: the tzolk'in, haab, and long count.</p>

<p>The <em>tzolk'in</em> was the sacred calendar, with a 260-day cycle generated by a 13-day cycle of numbers and a 20-day cycle of names. Its origins are unclear--speculations have ranged from astronomy and numerology to agriculture and the length of human pregnancy--and it probably originated with the Olmecs before 1200 B.C.E.</p>

<p>The <em>haab</em> was the civil calendar. It featured 18 "months" of 20 days, followed by five additional days to complete a 365-day cycle. This five-day Wayeb' (or Uayeb) was considered unlucky. Day numbers are zero-based. The first use of the haab was probably around 550 B.C.E. As with the tzolk'in, there is no year number as such, so the haab could not be used for long-term record keeping.</p>

<p>The <em>long count</em> was used to track long periods of time. It is essentially a base-twenty positional notation, with one exception: there are 20 k'in (days) in one uinal, but only 18 winal in one tun, so that a tun is roughly a solar year. There are then 20 tun in a k'atun, 20 k'atun in a b'ak'tun, and 20 b'ak'tun in a pictun, with even longer units occasionally referenced that would cover billions of years. Note that the Mayans were ahead of their European contemporaries not only in developing positional notation but also in their use of zero.</p>

<p>All three calendars are arithmetic. The haab is a solar calendar, though the fixed 365-day year means that the seasons slowly cycle through the year. The 360-day tun of the long count was surely also intended to approximate the solar year.</p>

<p>The epoch of the Mayan long count is generally accepted as that given by the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation, Julian Day 584,283, i.e., 11 August 3114 B.C.E. (Gregorian).</p>

<p>The recent New Age notion that the Mayans predicted the end of the world at the end of b'ak'tun 12 is a misinterpretation of Mayan beliefs.</p>
