<p>The Hindus have both lunisolar and solar calendars.</p>

<p>Both calendars have evolved over the centuries. The systems were standardized in the <em>Surya Siddhānta</em> in the Third Century C.E., and improved by later astronomers. The "old" version used here is based on work by Āryabhaṭa (499 C.E.) as amended by Lalla (720-790 C.E.) The modern version was developed by Bhaskara around 1100 C.E. There are significant regional differences in the Hindu calendars. The version presented here is the southern amânta system, used in most of southern India.</p>

<p>Both calendars feature months and years, but in the lunisolar calendar there may be two consecutive months with the same name, the first being designated as leap (adhika or prathama) and second as common (niga or dvitīya). Thus a lunisolar year may have thirteen months, while a solar year always has twelve. In the lunisolar calendar there are also occasional "lost" days, where a day number in a month is skipped. In the modern lunisolar calendar, there are occasionally lost months (kshaya), too, and there are also leap days, two consecutive with the same number, the second designated as leap (adhika).</p>

<p>Quasi-astronomical. Old versions are computed as if the motions of the Sun and Moon are uniform, using mean value estimates of the length of the lunar and solar months (1/12th of a solar year). The modern version uses a rather sophisticated computational model to estimate the true positions of the Sun and Moon. Of course this 12th Century (C.E.) model does not quite match the accuracy of modern ephemerides.</p>

<p>Epoch: Hindu calendars have used various epochs. In Hindu chronology, we are in the Kali Yuga (Iron Age), the 432,000-year fourth and final era in the current 4,320,000-year chaturyuga. (Two thousand chaturyuga are a single day in the long life of the Brahmā, the creator.) For the old versions of the Hindu calendar, we use the Kali Yuga epoch: year 0 began on Julian Day 588,466 (23 January 3102 B.C.E. Gregorian). For the modern solar calendar, we follow the Indian national civil calendar, which uses the Śaka era in which year 0 began on Julian Day 1,749,621 (13 March 78 C.E. Gregorian). For the modern lunisolar calendar we use the Vikrama era in which year 0 began on Julian Day 1,700,677 (12 March 57 B.C.E. Gregorian). (The Śaka, or Shalivahana, era is associated with southern India; the Vikrama era with northern India.)</p>

<p>Note that Hindu calendars generally reckon in terms of "expired" (or elapsed) year numbers, rather than ordinals. This seems fitting, since the concept of zero originated in India (in the Old World; the Olmecs and Mayans developed it independently in Mesoamerica).</p>
