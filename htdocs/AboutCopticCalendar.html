<p>The calendar of the Egyptian Christians, the Copts.</p>

<p>Based on the ancient Egyptian civil calendar, but leap days are added to the epagomenê. This reform was originally proposed in the Decree of Canopus honoring Pharaoh Ptolemy III in 238 B.C.E., but was not implemented until 25 B.C.E. by decree the the Roman Emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>Twelve months of thirty days each, followed by five extra days (epagomené) in common years, and six in leap years, which occur every fourth year.</p>

<p>Arithmetic. Closer to a solar calendar than the Egyptian because of the leap-day structure (which makes it as accurately solar as the Julian calendar). Quasi-lunar in the same sense as the Egyptian calendar.</p>

<p>Epoch: Year 1 Anno Martyrum (A.M.) began on Julian Day 1,825,030 (29 August 284 C.E. Gregorian), the first year of the reign of Roman Emperor Diocletian.</p>

<p>The day begins at sunset.</p>
