<p>The calendar of the Muslims.</p>

<p>Usually attributed to Caliph Umar I, in A.H. 17 (A.D. 639).</p>

<p>Twelve months of 29 or 30 days each every year.</p>

<p>Strictly lunar. Each month begins following the New Moon. A variety of schemes for determining this are used in different parts of the Muslim world.</p>

<p>Traditionally, observers have watched for the first thin crescent Moon (hilāl). This practice is still widely followed, especially for religious purposes, such as establishing the holy month of Ramaḍān. It is the practice in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Morocco, among others.</p>

<p>The practical desire to prepare calendars in advance has motivated a longstanding Muslim interest in astronomy. Various rules based on computable astronomical phenomena have been and are used. An increasingly popular rule is the current Umm al-Qura calendar used on the Arabian peninsula and approved in 2007 C.E. for use by the Islamic Society of North America, the Fiqh Council of North America, and the European Council for Fatwa and Research. It predicts hilāl visibility if the New Moon occurs before and moonset occurs after sunset in Mecca.</p>

<p>There is also a long tradition of using algorithmic (a.k.a. tabular) methods. In all of these the months have fixed lengths except the twelfth, Dhu al-Ḥijja, which has 30 days in leap years, which are determined according to a fixed sequence in a 30-year cycle. One such sequence, called Nizari, was developed in the second hijra century. Another, known as Labban or the Kuwaiti algorithm, has been used in some of Microsoft's software.</p>

<p>Epoch: Year 1 Anno Hegiræ (A.H.) is the year of the hijra, Mohammed's emigration to Medina. It began on Julian Day 1,948,440 (19 July 622 C.E. Gregorian).</p>
